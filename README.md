# Dynamic Insights Engine

## Introduction
This repository is home to the Dynamic Insights Engine, a microservices-based platform designed to facilitate data participation and analysis. The project integrates multiple microservices, each serving a distinct role in the pipeline, to handle diverse data sources and streamline the process of data analysis and reporting.

## Microservices Architecture

Below is a brief overview of each microservice contained within this project:

- **APIGateway**: The entry point for all incoming requests, directing traffic to appropriate services.
- **AuxiliaryDataInputServices**: Manages the intake of auxiliary data streams.
- **ChangeDetectorServices**: Monitors data for significant changes or anomalies.
- **CodeSupplierService**: Provides necessary code resources for dynamic analysis.
- **ConfigService**: Centralized configuration management for all services.
- **DynamicServiceGeneratorService**: Creates services on-the-fly as per analysis needs.
- **RegistryService**: Service discovery and registration mechanism.
- **ReportingServices**: Generates comprehensive reports from analyzed data.
- **Scoring**: Evaluates and scores data based on predefined metrics.
- **data-input-service**: Handles the primary data input flow.
- **input-creator-service**: Constructs input data structures for processing.

Each folder in this repository represents an individual microservice that
## Technologies
- **Java**: The primary programming language for service development.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications.
- **Netflix Zuul**: Provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, and security.
- **Ribbon**: Client-side load balancing in microservices.
- **Netflix Hystrix**: Offers latency and fault tolerance.
- **Zipkin**: Distributed tracing system for timing data collection.
- **Spring Cloud**: Tools for developers to quickly build common patterns in distributed systems.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to package and run the services.
- **Kafka**: Messaging system for building real-time data pipelines.
- **RESTful APIs**: Interface for services to communicate with each other.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for high-volume data storage.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes in source code.

## Deployment
The suite of microservices within the Dynamic Insights Engine has been deployed successfully, ensuring a robust and scalable environment for real-time data processing and analysis.

## Conclusion
The Dynamic Insights Engine is a testament to modern software architecture's potential to transform data into actionable insights. This system is designed to adapt quickly to changing requirements and scale seamlessly with demand.

We are proud to present this as an open-source project and welcome contributions and feedback from the developer community.
