Sure, let's consider two data topics, CDS_1 and CDS_2, with one data per minute, and a time window of 1 minute. Here is the example data:

Window 1: CDS_1: [0] CDS_2: [1] Weighted Interaction: -1

Window 2: CDS_1: [1] CDS_2: [0] Weighted Interaction: -1

Window 3: CDS_1: [1] CDS_2: [1] Weighted Interaction: 1

Window 4: CDS_1: [0] CDS_2: [0] Weighted Interaction: 1

After processing all the windows, let's assume that the sensitivity index for CDS_1 and CDS_2 is as follows:

Sensitivity Index (SI_1_2): Window 1: -1 Window 2: -2 Window 3: -1 Window 4: 0

Now, let's calculate the normalized sensitivity index using the formula:

Normalized Sensitivity Index (NSI_1_2) = [(SI_1_2 - min(SI_1_2))/(max(SI_1_2) - min(SI_1_2))]

In this case, the minimum sensitivity index is -2, and the maximum sensitivity index is 1. Using this information, we can compute the normalized sensitivity index as follows:

NSI_1_2: Window 1: 0.5 Window 2: 0.0 Window 3: 0.5 Window 4: 1.0

Note that the normalized sensitivity index ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the sensitivity index is at the minimum value observed so far, and 1 indicates that the sensitivity index is at the maximum value observed so far.
